You may well wonder at the continuing popularity of Greek mythology in the twenty-first century. The term ‘Greek Mythology’ conjures up images of impossibly beautiful gods and goddesses, fire and brimstone, roaring beasts and larger-than-life heroes. On the surface, they may seem like impossible flights of fancy written by ancient philosophers. However, we need to keep in mind that these stories were written by people like Socrates, Homer and Aristotle, whose brilliant minds have made them immortal in the annals of human history. The truth is, Greek myths are not only rooted in reality but have helped shape modern thinking in many important ways. Their mythical nature does not take away from the fact they contain important morals and teachings that are as relevant now as they were thousands of years ago. Knowledge of Greek mythology has long-influenced society in subtle ways. It has shaped culture and tradition, directed political systems and encouraged problem-solving. It would be fair to say that the whole basic concept of modern thinking can be traced back to Greek stories and the valuable lessons they taught. Many words used in the modern English language like idol, antique, dialogue, economy, spartan, architect, microscope, telephone, plus many more have been derived from the Greek language. The Greeks were the first to have a full-fledged alphabet system replete with vowels and consonants. According to an estimate, more than 150,000 words in the English language are derived from ancient Greek. We can find allusions to Greek mythological figures in modern-day literature as well. For example, C.S. Lewis’s ‘Till We Have Faces’ is a retelling of the Greek tale of Cupid (Eros in Greek) and Psyche. Similarly, Mary Shelley incorporated the theme of Prometheus in her book, ‘Frankenstein’. Hermione, the well-known character in Harry Potter, owes her name to Greek mythology. Hermione was the daughter of Helen of Troy and the King of Sparta.If you notice, several global companies have been named after Greek mythical figures. For example:

Amazon: Amazons were fierce female warriors who participated in the Trojan War – this is also where the Amazon River got its title, whose name the global online shopping platform has since borrowed.
Eos: The goddess of dawn – is today known as a line of cameras produced by Canon.
Pandora: The first human woman, endowed with unique gifts bestowed upon her by the gods – now a jewellery manufacturer.
Olympus: The Greek mountain – now a brand of cameras.
Oracle: Mortal psychic or seer – now known as the popular database software company.
There’s a reason companies like to brand their products and services after characters of Greek mythology. The public tends to subconsciously associate the features of the brand with those of the original mythical character. Nike, for example, was the goddess of victory, so it made sense for a sports brand to name themselves after her.

Several successful and popular movies have been made based on stories from Greek mythology including the famous Percy Jackson series and others, including Clash of the Titans, Wrath of the Titans, Hercules, Helen of Troy, Ulysses, and many more. Most of these movies went on to become hits – given the larger-than-life canvas for showcasing grand emotions including joy, sorrow, sacrifice, love, victory, jealousy, betrayal and loss. The stunning visuals were enhanced with a gripping original storyline derived from the original Greek stories. Achilles was all-powerful except in his heel. The story tells us that even a small or seemingly insignificant flaw can prove fatal and stop us from achieving our goals. Similarly, the myth of Hercules reveals the value of loyalty, strength of character and honour. Hector, the son of Troy, is forced to fight Achilles and runs for his life, only to return later and fight the battle to the finish. The tale embodies the importance of overcoming your fears and facing challenges. The legend of Odysseus is about how you can triumph over obstacles and use perseverance to achieve your goals. The story of Theseus and the Minotaur teaches us to stop, pause and reflect even when we’re under stress. After all, Theseus forgets to put up his white sails after his victory over the Minotaur and King Aegeus falls to his death before learning of his son’s return. You can teach good behaviour and moral thinking to children through the tales of Greek mythology. Dealing with jealousy and emotional blackmail? Read them the story of Hercules and the Goddess Hera. Struggling to handle sibling rivalry? Ask the children to read the story of Arachne and Athena. Greek mythology is as fascinating now as it was thousands of years ago. However, they are much more than simply a collection of enchanting tales. Most of them can be described as psychological allegories that deal with the complex, subtle and recurring problems of human existence. Greek mythology is a reflection of past civilizations and provides us with crucial insights into historical events, ancient cultures, relationships, human alliances and much more. Since they are creative and appealing to read, we imbibe those lessons subconsciously while enjoying a thoroughly captivating reading experience.

I would be able to gain deeper insight into my company and its industry along with what power it holds. I choose Amazon and tesla, as both companies have expanded and hold a large influence with amazon continuously expanding its market and products along with tesla's innovation. My third choice is the H DISEC since each country wants to push its own interests while cooperating with others. It would make an interesting debate since this committee needs to protect citizens' rights with the regulation of arms and biological warfare etc. while countries need weapons in order to protect themselves.

This was a period of time in world history completely unique with no other periods coming close to the complete hold America had on the world's peoples and economies. That is why I chose the Fed chair as my first choice. To represent the interests of America at that time in this committee sounds highly interesting and I would love to also have a chance to fully explore and flesh out my ideas on the topic in my position paper. Following that I chose ExxonMobil because alongside American interests I also am fascinated by the hold that big oil had on the American economy and government in the early 2000s with American fuel companies being arguably the entities who profited the most off of the Iraq war. Finally I chose the ROC Minister of Defense because of the position Taiwan found itself in during the early 2000s with that being a period of both prosperity and fear with Taiwan's economy and especially its electronics industry booming however at the same time facing the threat of a rapidly modernizing China, with fear still circulating despite promises of a 'peaceful rise.' For my second choice I chose the OPHCC because of the subterfuge inherent to the committee as well as the interesting nature of the setting. I had never heard about this operation before but it sounds incredibly interesting. Furthermore the role of minigames and delving into human behavior is an aspect of Model UN that I feel is not often explored enough and I feel this would be a great opportunity to really dive in. Finally I chose the Ancient Amazons Crisis Committee because I have never been in a smaller committee like that but that seems like a cool opportunity. Also the setting of the committee seems very interesting though there is still very little info about it.",Though I have only been to one MUN conference so far I loved my experience there and immediately after it concluded I knew that I wanted to do another as soon as possible.

I quite literally read about it for fun, so I know for certain that I would have a uniquely enjoyable time representing Deutsche Bank. I would also have included the ECB as one of my lower choices, but one of my other delegates really wants to do the ECB, hence why I didn't bother to list it. I included Tony Blair because of his influence both in Europe overall and the United Kingdom, particularly because he's a Labour politician, making the party-politics aspect of his character far more interesting. I would love to represent Blair almost as much as Deutsche. For SoS, I thought this would generally just be a good opportunity to use both some of my political knowledge and discuss the geopolitical implications of the actions of businesses.

For the H-AFL-CIO choices, I pretty much just went with unions I've already learned about, plus an important figure (Sweeney) who I'm assuming will be uniquely interesting to represent.

For the last committee, France is a country with a massive military that often intervenes in West Africa. Morocco, obviously, has a direct interest in the Western Sahara conflict, and Saudi Arabia I thought would generally be interesting to represent as they are a relatively militaristic country in the Middle East with a unique financial status.","This will be my last conference in High School, so I would love to end it with a unique committee experience.

I'd like to challenge myself with positions that could require more research. 

I'm also passionate about the commission on non-governmental organizations. I love the idea of organizations providing aid and relief in emergency situations, and would want to represent a position that provides that aid. 

The international maritime organization seems interesting and I'd like too learn about the roles of the IMO, including its prevention of maritime pollution and the economic effect and regulation of imports and exports.

The thousands of myths surrounding the Greek peoples have captured my attention since in was in middle school and I really want to take this as an opportunity to dive in further to the legends surrounding the people included in this committee. The reason I chose Calliope as my first choice because her story of being an excellent writer and intelligent muse who was able to inspire many people. I chose Penthysilea because of her strength and ability to lead. Her willpower can be seen as inspiring and could also be used in a committee setting. Lastly, the reason I chose Antiope is that her story is quite different from the other two that I have picked out. Instead of being loyal, having strength, or using intelligence to figure your way out, she acted out of love and in turn felt extreme anger when she was betrayed by the one she loved. 
I found H-CC interesting due to the time period it is set in and all of the information that you could have the chance to uncover if you were to participate in this committee. I picked these agents because of the mystery behind their position and what could unfold with them. 
Historical DISEC’s topic can be a really fun topic to debate about and any solutions produced during debate could be insightful to hear as many countries could have different stances. For my first choice, I chose Moldova because of it’s past of being apart of the Soviet Union. The country’s history with the USSR would be really enlightening to research upon. Seeing Moldova’s opinion on the topics that are being presented would be quite interesting.

I also picked this committee because it is introductory and I wanted an introductory committee for my first conference.

Egypt plays a major role in the supply chain due to their close proximity to the Red Sea pirates, and the Suez Canal running through their land and being operated through the state-run SCA (Suez Canal Authority). 
China is the export powerhouse of the globe, and is practically guaranteed to being a major player in the debates, along with likely being the de facto leader of an export-focused bloc. 
The USA is similar to China, except it the the import powerhouse.

Raytheon is the only defense and aerospace focused corporation out of all of the countries, and therefore will play a major role in solving many of the issues at hand through the supplying of important weapons.

For Arctic Council, I picked the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North because it is an organization that I personally was not aware of, so I'm interested in getting to know more about it. I love researching new topics! This curiosity applies to why I picked the Inuit Circumpolar Council as well. As for Canada, it is a leading country in the Arctic Council, so I'd love to represent such an important part of the organization. 
For the Counter Terrorism Committee, I picked India because as I grew up in an Indian household, I have heard news about terrorist issues and have been interested in them since I heard about it.

For my second choice committee, I chose the Arctic Council mainly because I don't know anything about it, and I would like to learn more. The council choices I made within that committee were arbitrary. 

I chose the Counter terrorism committee third because terrorism has consistently been a threat in the US and I should learn about the security measures that are used to prevent terrorism.

A more specific and regional committee will allow me to apply previous abilities used in other types of committees, but also pushes me to develop other skills that dive deeper into the topic due to the more centered nature of ECOSOC. Furthermore, exploring the topic of the Arctic interests me as it is a region that is quite different from most places due to its specific geographical location that affects its unique climate, biodiversity, resources, and accessibility. Thus, the manner to approach topics and issues surrounding this region will vary too.
