I chose random positions because there is no information on any positions before a few days before committee begins. A factor that influenced my decision making on AD-HOC positions however was how interesting the name seemed.

My second choice was OP-HCC as revolution in Italy and secret revolutionary groups as a whole is a fun concept to me. I chose positions within the committee based on relevance in actual life, with all three of these positions being great changemakers throughout the real event, and provide a strong enough base for me to be creative within commitee. In addition, the revolution seems like a fun setting to do a crisis in.

My third choice is ABA as it seems like a new committee that adds new dimensions to the standard ecosoc committee. With potential for altered or new ROP and interesting and culturally relevant positions, the committee seems interesting to be a part of.

For KingMUN this year, I want to explore other types of committee that is not based on national representation.

The grand Olympus, showcasing ""divine"" gods and goddesses with individually unique powers, is a world of bizarre madness. Each god or goddess 
 holds different desires and motivations, ultimately leading controversy, creating nemesis, and raging war. Every Greek mythology displays the consequences from issues of reality, often reflected from human's damned desire of having through the deities. I find the stories very amusing and so fun because of their creative story plot and interesting characters. I knew COO was the only one because at first glance it stole my heart's passion. Athena one of the leading character in the Trojan War, I love her witty solution of the horse, and I raised her as my role model in 2nd grade. The Godess of Love, Aphrodite, was the leading cause of the war. She basically brought the fun, so she's my favorite. Hera, the queen dedicates all her efforts for the fall of Paris. The hatred of one is extremely motivating. I plan to bring the same passion in the MUN event!

The Food and Agriculture Association caught my attention because recently we learned about GMOs in science class and had a debate. During the unit I found interest in providing the best solution for the health of the public, to which I concluded to anti-GMO. I chose my position as European Food Safety Authority and ECDC because EU has increasing concern about food safety as a whole and I want to make a change for as many country as possible.

As an ardent follower of Percy Jackson and the Olympians, I understand the fallibility of the gods all too well. Their petty conflicts often disrupt the lives of mortals and threaten the delicate balance of the world. Choosing to represent the Council of Olympus in Model UN provides a unique opportunity to delve into the complexities of divine politics and strive for a semblance of order amidst their chaos. I am eager to embody the roles of these capricious deities I read of as a child, navigating their whims and vendettas while advocating for the sovereignty of Attica and deliberating the fate of the Trojan War with diplomacy and tact. 
Athena - Athena is known for her strategic intellect and rational thinking, attributes that could be crucial in navigating the complexities of the Council of Olympus. Additionally, being the goddess of War and Wisdom, Athena’s insights into conflict resolution and negotiation could align well with my goals for advocating for the sovereignty of Attica and addressing the ramifications of the Trojan War. Choosing Athena would provide a strong foundation for my argument, emphasizing the importance of wisdom and diplomacy in managing divine disputes and mortal affairs. 
Poseidon - As Lord of the Oceans, Poseidon’s domain encompasses vast depths and turbulent waters, mirroring the unpredictable nature of divine politics and conflicts. Choosing to represent Poseidon allows me to delve into the complexities of the gods’ interactions while emphasizing the disruptive impact their disputes have on mortal lives. Poseidon’s involvement in mythological narratives often intersects with mortal affairs, providing ample opportunities to advocate for the sovereignty of Attica and address the repercussions of the Trojan War with diplomacy and tact. Therefore, Poseidon remains a compelling choice that aligns well with my perception of the fallibility of the gods. 
Eris - Eris embodies the chaos and discord among the gods, which aligns with my understanding of their petty conflicts disrupting mortal lives. By representing Eris, I could delve deeper into the complexities of divine politics and the disruptive nature of their squabbles, emphasizing the need for diplomacy and order amidst the chaos. Additionally, advocating for Eris would highlight my commitment to navigating the capricious nature of the gods while striving for a semblance of stability and balance in the affairs of Olympus. 
HCC:
I want to do this committee as my second option because it offers a dynamic and immersive simulation experience that challenges delegates to their feet to adapt to changing circumstances and collaborate with others to address complex crises. 
Saigō Takamori  - Saigō Takamori is the leader of the discontented samurai and the central figure in the potential revolt against the imperial government. She would have the opportunity to shape the course of the rebellion and negotiate others.
Emperor Meiji - Emperor Meiji would hold considerable authority over the imperial forces and overall direction of the nation. He would have the power to make critical decisions regarding military strategy and diplomacy. 
Ito Hirobumi - Ito Hirobumi was a key figure in the Meiji government and played a significant role in shaping Japan’s political structure. He would have the opportunity to strategize and implement policies aimed at addressing the grievances of the samurai while maintaining the stability of the government. 
FCC:
I want to participate in this committee as my third option because it offers a thrilling experience, allowing me to embark on an exciting expedition into uncharted territory, confront dangerous monsters, conduct vital research, and collaborate with a diverse team to overcome life-threatening crises, all within the futuristic setting of 2052. 
General Hamptons - General Hamptons would bring his leadership skills and experience in crisis management to the expedition team. 
Dr. FJ Eckleburg - Dr. FJ Eckleburg could contribute to the team by conducting vital research on the encountered monsters, newly discovered territories, and any other scientific phenomena encountered during the journey.
Sarah Sordinsky - BBC News Journalist - As a journalist, Sarah Sordinsky could provide valuable communication and media skills to the expedition team by documenting the team’s experiences, disseminate important information to the public or authorities and help maintain morale.","On my first time doing Model UN, I won an award representing the United States for Best Position Paper.

Though I have previous experience in the world of Model UN, I haven’t participated in a specialized committee before and I believe having personal interest in the topics will significantly help me develop and collaborate.

Poseidon: As the god of the sea, Poseidon could be invested in protecting the sovereignty of Attica, the region that encompasses Athens and famously associated with Athena. While Athena is often regarded as the patroness of Athens, Poseidon also has a stake in the region due to his mythological connection with the creation of Athens itself. His interest in the region's sovereignty would stem from both his rivalry with Athena and his desire to assert influence over coastal territories. With his significant political power, Poseidon would be able to offer support to different resolutions and collaborate with other gods to challenge Athena’s rule. Poseidon's involvement in the Trojan War showcases his support for the Greeks (Achaeans) against the Trojans. Poseidon's allegiance to the Greeks could align with his broader interests in sea dominance and control over coastal regions, as well as his rivalry with other gods, such as Apollo and Hera, who supported the Trojans. Additionally, Poseidon is held with high importance in the Percy Jackson series, providing me with additional background knowledge and further interest in his positions and character.

Athena: Athena would provide strategic guidance for the council, when addressing Attica's sovereignty, As the goddess of wisdom, Athena would advocate for decision-making that upholds the sovereignty and interests of Attica, utilizing her strategies to navigate diplomatic relations and potential threats to the region's autonomy. During the Trojan War, Athena's influence within the Council of Olympus would be instrumental in shaping the strategies employed by the Greek forces. Athena would work tirelessly to ensure the success of the Greek coalition against Troy. In the committee Athena would advocate for tactical maneuvers and military strategies aimed at weakening the Trojan defenses and securing victory for the Greeks. Her wisdom would guide the council in orchestrating decisive actions that align with the broader goals of the Greek alliance. Her position would be very influential and key in developing blocs.

Aphrodite: Aphrodite's role in matters concerning Attica sovereignty and the Trojan War would likely emphasize diplomatic efforts and the preservation of harmony. Regarding Attica sovereignty, Aphrodite might advocate for a balanced approach that respects the sovereignty of Attica while promoting peaceful relations and alliances with neighboring regions. Her influence could be pivotal in resolving conflicts and fostering diplomatic solutions to territorial conflicts, prioritizing understanding among the parties. During the Trojan War, Aphrodite's support for Troy, stemming from her allegiance to Paris after being promised the love of the most beautiful mortal, would highlight her commitment to protecting relationships and ensuring the well-being of those under her patronage. She may work to mitigate the conflict's escalation, seeking avenues for reconciliation and peace talks, while also employing her persuasive charm to rally support for diplomatic resolutions within the council. Aphrodite’s involvement in these issues marks her as an important position to take.

The International Olympic Committee address issues relating to sports which hold of importance to me as an athlete. In Seattle mun, I participated as a member of Interpol where we discussed similar topics, providing me prior experience with sports.

France: In the International Olympic Committee (IOC), France plays a significant role in addressing the impacts of infrastructure construction on host countries by advocating for sustainable development and responsible investment practices. France can leverage its expertise in urban planning and architecture to promote environmentally friendly infrastructure projects that leave a positive legacy for host communities. Additionally, France takes a firm stance against corruption in sport committees and leadership, advocating for transparency, accountability, and ethical governance practices to uphold the integrity of the Olympic movement.

United States: The United States plays a significant role in the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by advocating for sustainable infrastructure practices to minimize the adverse impacts of construction on host countries. The U.S. actively engages in efforts to combat corruption within sport committees and leadership, promoting transparency, accountability, and ethical governance to uphold the integrity of the Olympic movement. Through its leadership and influence, the United States would ensure that hosting the Olympic Games fosters positive, long-term benefits for host nations while maintaining the highest standards of integrity and fair play in sports governance.

China: China's role in the International Olympic Committee (IOC) regarding addressing the impacts of infrastructure (construction) on host countries involves advocating for sustainable development practices and legacy planning to minimize environmental and social impacts. Additionally, China emphasizes transparency and accountability measures to combat corruption in sport committees and leadership, promoting integrity and fairness in Olympic governance. Through active participation and collaboration with the countries in IOC, China would uphold the Olympic ideals of excellence, friendship, and respect while addressing these critical issues.

The ICAO plays a crucial role in implementing global standards and recommended practices for aviation safety and security. Through collaboration with member states and industry stakeholders, ICAO would mitigate risks, promote best practices, and enhance the safety and reliability of air travel worldwide.

Unites States: The United States plays a critical role in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) by actively contributing to the development and implementation of standards and regulations aimed at ensuring passenger safety and enhancing aircraft systems. Through its expertise, resources, and commitment to aviation safety, the United States collaborates with other member states within the ICAO framework to establish and enforce robust safety measures, ultimately fostering a safer and more efficient global aviation industry.

China: In the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), China plays a crucial role in advancing passenger safety through its contributions to the development and implementation of international aviation standards and regulations. Additionally, China's involvement in enhancing aircraft systems involves collaborative efforts with other member states to ensure the continuous improvement of aviation technologies and procedures for the safety and efficiency of air travel worldwide.

UK: The UK plays a significant role in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regarding passenger safety and aircraft systems by actively participating in the development and implementation of global standards and regulations. Through its expertise in aviation technology and safety protocols, the UK contributes to shaping policies that ensure the highest standards of safety and efficiency in air travel worldwide.",I would really appreciate it if I could receive my top choices because I have chosen them after a lot of consideration and I believe that having prior knowledge will significantly aid me during my first experience in a specialized commitee.,true,true,true,true,Deeksha Korada,Laxminarayana Korada,true,Standard Delegate,kingmun,3DR54926N1235281V,45,,2024-02-26T01:59:25.515Z,2024-02-27T05:43:44.621Z,Deeksha Korada,[object Object],IOC,France,

I picked the positions largely based on their names, Monsieur Lacazette seems like a master mind with a secret agenda, Ameila Caddel seems like someone who makes the people around her execute her plans while maintaining the credit, and Archibald Thornefield seems like the type to create an entire revenge arch simply because they told him his name was weird.
2. I chose OP-HCC because once again, I loved Seattlemun 2024's HCC and want to experience more HCC styles of committees. Giuseppe Mazzini was my first choice because I want to take on a major role in a committee, I want the chance to be in the spotlight sort of speak and I feel this position would definitely help with that. Louis Auguste Blanqui just sounds rich and posh and Marquis de Lafayette is fun to say. The both seem like aristocrats that would prove influential in the revolution.
3. I chose AD-HOC as my last choice because I heard people talking about this committee and praising it, so although I know nothing about this committee I wanted to give it a chance.

I picked Bangladesh due to the potentially strong narrative it holds as a developing country. With the discovery of magic, the options of energy production and methods of boosting the economy becomes endless. If taken that magic is also sustainable with minimal environmental impact, this further rids the issue of balancing development and sustainability, as the Western narrative that everything needs to be environmentally ""clean"" harms developing countries that want to be on the same playing field, thus creating an elitist barrier. I'm also partial to Bangladesh as that's where my parents come from. I picked India as my second choice due to the same line of reasoning, with the potential of magic creating a new balance of power that could shift away from the West. This is already a historical precedent with India's participation in BRICS, trying to wrestle economic dominance from relying purely on the dollar. I picked Denmark as my third option due to it's already established industry in alternative power sources and it commands a strong role in that department.

I picked the Geneva Convention as my second choice due to a personal interest in WWII-era history, I find the problems presented in the committee compelling and those that I would like to have my own answers to. I picked the UK as my first choice due to their importance in reconstruction. I picked Poland as my second option due to its significance as being a country whose people were taken, slaughtered, or displaced. I picked France as my third option due to its position as being a country that needed reconstruction and was a pivotal part in WW2.

I picked the ICAO as my third option due to my loose interest in aviation technology due to coming from a dad who works in the industry.

I decided to join the F-GA committee because of its magical and innovative environment. My goal in taking part in F-GA is to push myself and explore CRISIS in such an awesome environment. With the advent of magic as a tool, there are exciting opportunities to redefine power dynamics and diplomatic protocols. I'm also eager to work my ""magic"" (as I love Harry Potter) and influence how power relations and magic develop in this special committee.
Chosen Positions:
USA: I chose the USA due to its status as a major global power and its significant influence in international affairs. 
China: China's growing global influence was why I chose it for F-GA.
UK: The United Kingdom's historical ties to international diplomacy was why I thought it was a suitable choice for the F-GA committee. 
Committee #2: TRUSTEES
I selected the TRUSTEES committee due to its focus on governance and international diplomacy. TRUSTEES' two topics, ""Crisis: Imperialist Instability in Latin America (1955–1965)"" and ""The Coup Conflicts in Latin America (1955–1965),"" present challenging political scenarios and fascinating historical contexts. By participating in TRUSTEES, I aim to delve into the historical dynamics of Latin American politics during the mid-20th century, examining the issues of interventionism and regional stability.  Additionally, I wanted to challenge myself and explore crisis situations.
USA: I selected USA for the TRUSTEES committee due to its historical involvement in Latin America and its influence in global affairs during the mid-20th century. 
USSR: I chose to represent the USSR because it provides a historical perspective on global governance. The USSR's legacy as a former superpower and its involvement in international organizations offer insights into issues relevant to the TRUSTEES committee's focus.
China: China's growing influence in global governance structures and its role in shaping international institutions make it a relevant choice for the TRUSTEES committee.
Committee #3:  COO
The Council of Olympus committee appealed to me because of its distinct and captivating backdrop inside Greek mythology. Greek mythology's subject diversity and the erratic intentions and interpersonal conflicts of the gods caught my interest and offered an ideal environment for innovative role-playing and diplomatic discussions. I want to investigate mythical stories, take on the roles of mythological characters, and have original diplomatic discussions by taking part in the Council of Olympus.
Chosen Positions:
Athena, Goddess of War and Wisdom: I chose Athena for the COO committee because of her domain as the goddess of war and wisdom, aligning perfectly with the committee's thematic focus on war, sovereignty, and mythological narratives. As one of the principal Olympian gods associated with warfare and strategic counsel, Athena's participation in the council discussions would be pivotal in shaping the decisions related to the sovereignty of Attica and the fate of the Trojan War.
Poseidon, Lord of the Oceans: Poseidon's dominion over the seas and his rivalry with Athena make him a relevant choice for the COO committee. His perspectives on maritime issues, territorial disputes, and his involvement in mythological narratives related to the topics would enrich discussions.
Hades, Lord of the Underworld:  While not traditionally associated with mortal affairs, Hades' insights into the afterlife, the treatment of the deceased, and the consequences of war could provide valuable contributions to the COO.",I am a very motivated individual and I want to succeed in MUN.

Being able to partake in this adventure as a court of Olympian Gods in Model UN would be an amazing opportunity to look deeper into the divine conflicts and government on Mount Olympus. I would love to delve deeper into the mayhem the gods create along with their politics and hierarchy. I can’t wait to become a part of the stories I’ve read about and grown up with. 

	Poseidon, Lord of The Oceans who encompasses the watery expanses of the world, and the harsh riptides, mirrors the unbalanced, vindictive fights between the deities. Poseidon’s involvement in godly interactions helps me learn more and enquire into how the disputes of the Olympians cause distress in mortal’s lives. How Poseidon reacts to human affairs addresses the repercussions of the Trojan War and the sovereignty of Attica. Thus, to look through Poseidon’s eyes into the court of the Olympians would be an excellent way to understand more about the ways of governing as an immortal.

	Persephone, Goddess of spring, would be a persuasive position to take. Her powers, all though thought of less by others, hold a key into both the affairs of the underworld and the upperworld. Her insight into the divergences of the gods, from her position as a witness is thoughtful. She holds a terrific place as the Queen of the Underworld ruling by the side of Hades, who forever despises his brethren. Therefore, Persephone is a strong candidate to lead us into the war both above and under the god’s dispute.
	
	Hera, known as the divine Queen of Olympus, holds a powerful place as Zeus’s wife. Her input and involvement in the paltry quarrels of the gods gives us visual into the debates on either side of the godly court. Her perspective during her fight with Athena and Aphrodite leads us into combat. She is astute and has a strong way to show her point of view and ideals. Her relations with mortals like Jason and Hercules show us that a small grudge she may have, goes a long way. So, her view into the divine politics and ruling at Olympus is valuable.
	
(FAO): Arla Foods, the fifth largest dairy company in the world, with around 56 percent of sales in the European food market. They hold a strong place when it comes to animal welfare and as such a huge company make important decisions around this topic.

Ben and Jerry’s one of the most known ice cream and dairy companies, with around 450 million worldwide revenues. They hold an exclusive point of view into the food industry and as a dairy company into animal welfare. So, Ben and Jerry’s as a company would help me delve deeper into the world of food and dairy.

The FSANZ (Food standards Australia and New Zealand) even if lesser known holds a key into Australia’s diverse wildlife and food production services. Using this you can take a deep dive into the quality of food in Australia seeing as it is a small yet various, from the animals to the plants.
(HCC): Yamagata Aritomo a twice elected prime minister and military commander. He held a powerful position in the Imperial Japanese Army, which will show us how the armies and militias reacted to the revolts. As a political leader he shows us the debates the leaders must've had to solve dilemmas.

Beppu Shinsuke, a strong samurai in the battle for the Satsuma domain gives us eyes into the war and the other samurais around him. His perspective from the field of war will show us into a strong lead onto the politics of the revolt.
Kirino Toshiaki, another samurai and the imperial army general gives us insight into the battle strategies and plans the samurais had and used for attack. It is also helpful when seeing the ideas that went through them when faced with failure.",,true,true,true,true,Neha Gopisetty,Kalpana pantula,true,Standard Delegate,kingmun,8U508061S88649017,45,,2024-02-27T06:04:56.776Z,2024-02-29T16:03:23.069Z,Neha Gopisetty,[object Object],FAO,Arla Foods,

My reasoning for this is that by choosing smaller positions, I can learn the basic experience of Model United Nations slowly without having to play a big role in the conference and having all the knowledge come at me at once.

        - I chose Scamander second as he was a Trojan warrior who strongly opposed Achilles which can get very interesting to debate upon.
        - I chose Demeter third due to her hatred of Poseidon which will likely lead to very strong opinions regarding Attica and the Trojan War
- I chose HCC second as I never knew about the Satsuma Rebellion, and it is a part of history that I would like to learn about through this committee.
        - I chose Fukuzawa Yukichi first because his views as an author and educator were very different from those of others including the government and other philosophers. He is also considered one of the most influential figures in Japanese history today.
        - I chose Kido Takayoshi second because he was one of the Three Great Nobles and is regarded as one of the modern founders of Japan.
        - I chose Okubo Toshimichi for the same reason, but placed him third because there were less results about him than there were for Kido Takayoshi.
- I chose H-GC third because the Geneva Conventions were and still are very the basis of humanitarian law today, hence they are very important and relevant, especially to me as I am involved in Red Cross.
        - I chose the United Kingdom first because they have had a long history with the Geneva Conventions and have also seen countless war crimes throughout the 20th century.
        - I chose Japan second due to their horrible history of breaking the Geneva Conventions in WWII as well as their journey in recovering from these atrocities of war.

I believe those incidents will provide helpful information to research in preparation for the conference. I think the topics of passenger safety and integration of UAVs in ICAO are important to discuss and propose solutions for, especially given the current state of the world with lots of conflicts and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. If given a position in ICAO, I will be willing to conduct extensive research and preparation about my country's position.
I also chose the Geneva Convention because of my interest in World War 2 and the aftermath, as well as the international rules surrounding treatment of civilians in times of turmoil. I believe the topics discussed significantly impact the world today, given all the conflicts going on which affect civilians.
Finally, I chose the Fantasy General Assembly because of how enchanting the setting sounds.

I want to learn more about what goes into making a decision that affects a lot of people, especially when it comes to those displaced. My first choice is Canada because they are open to refugees and helping displaced people in times of need. I think that it would be interesting to be a country that is very involved in this discussion as it is my first time attending a conference. As for Mexico, many people have been displaced from Mexico, so it would be interesting to be a country that has experienced a lot of displaced individuals. My third choice is Denmark because they are not open to helping displaced peoples, and it is always fun to be a country that does controversial things. My second choice for committee is Council of Olympus because it seems super fun to act as a Greek God - it is not a traditional committee. My first choice is Persephone because she is generally kind and receptive to others, and Demeter is second because I think that her story is very interesting. My last choice is Iris because I think it might be interesting to be a minor god, especially one that is known for being the ""Messenger of Olympus"". My last choice for committee is the Fantasy General Assembly because it is introductory, and seems like a good way to get the hang of Model UN. My first choice is the U.S.A. because the food industry in this country is something I do not know enough about, and it would be a great opportunity to learn more. My second choice is China because I know that their food industry is controversial, and it would be fun to be that country in this committee. My last choice is the U.K. because they are a major world power, and a good country to be in an introductory committee.","I want to learn as much as I can about Model UN from this conference, so if there is a committee that would help be get the gist of Model UN the best, that is the committee I wish to participate in.",true,true,true,true,Lily Narkunas,Gina Narkunas,true,Standard Delegate,kingmun,2DS50176S0425612V,45,,2024-02-29T02:51:46.241Z,2024-03-01T20:57:02.076Z,Lily Narkunas,[object Object],H-GC,"Mexico ",

I also have always been fascinated by the Trojan war and I think that discussing it would be really cool. It's something that really interests me, and the story of the Trojan war has so many lessons that can be applied to the modern day, as we face similar wars across the world. I think that Thetis would be a great position because, as the mother of Achilles, she would be directly impacted by the war and have strong opinions. Demeter and Iris would also be really interesting to represent because of their more neutral stance. For my second option, I've always thought it's really devastating how the Olympics causes so much disturbance to people who live in the host countries, especially because the people who are impacted the most are generally those who are in poverty. Mexico is my first choice because the Olympics were held there in 1968, and the effects of that would be interesting to talk about. Portugal and Colombia are regionally close to countries that hosted the Olympics. And for my third choice, I think that the relocation of refugees has rarely been done in the correct way, and it's really important to find a way to help these people who are facing the direct consequences of a war they didn't ask for. The Venezuela refugee crisis is why I put that as my top choice, because I think that there are a lot of things that could be talked about. Italy and Spain, as wealthier and more peaceful countries, would be interesting to represent because they would have the power to change things.",,true,true,false,false,Cora Barclay,Rebecca Barclay,true,Standard Delegate,kingmun,,45,65dcefcdd832c0001de48e8d,2024-02-29T03:55:31.380Z,2024-03-01T20:57:02.024Z,Cora Barclay,[object Object],IOC,Mexico,

Although I would consider myself new to the MUN, I would love to dive into the Future Crisis Committee to experience a new kind of Model UN. Since the positions are fictional, I chose names and roles that interested me in my ranking. A a Jewish teen, the Geneva Convention committee also held a lot of appeal since I am extremely interested in ethics and the impacts of WWII on human rights worldwide. My rankings were based on my knowledge of each countries involvement in WWII and the Geneva Conventions and I thought Poland would hold a strong opinion on the topic. The Council of Olympus committee intrigued me as well due to my love for Greek mythology. I ranked Thetis first, since the topic covers the Trojan War and Achilles was highly involved in that.

For my second choice comitte, the IOC, I chose Indonesia as my fist choice nation, as it is an area I have visited and I believe the unique angle of an island nation when discussing the effects of a large-scale sporting event such as the olympics in regards to the need for infrastructure would be intriguing to investigate.

Transparency in law as well as confidentiality in the digital age are subjects I've looked at a bit in school classes, and seem fascinating to debate on!
 
I also absolutely adore new specialized committee formats! I've been in Ad hoc once before, and deeply admire the amount of creativity that comes from having more freedom over your position's interpretation and the rapid pacing of debate. As a delegate, I haven't been in many committees where writing was the focus rather than debate's result, and would additionally highly appreciate the opportunity to refine my writing overall as it's not something often focused on within my school. Based on how the committee page additionally mentions mental preparation as well as observation, I'm sure it'll be an excitingly novel committee I'd love to be a part of!

I'm also hoping to redeem my performance at IPC PACMUN 2021, wherein my freshman self did not know how to write as a position! Since then, I've grown a ton in terms of general writing as well as writing resolutions/bills/public policy docs etc., which will be fun skill to test with this committee.
(It's also kinda silly how Tesfa sounds like Tesla hehe)

However, I'd also like to mention that the other two committees I chose are also highly interesting to me in terms of ROP and subject matter -- getting my second or third choice for committee would not be upsetting in any way to me.","I have a giant (and terrifying) science fair/competition about 2-3 weeks before when KINGMUN will probably be, which is why I chose Ad-Hoc as one of my top options, but I should hopefully be able to carve out enough prep time for more research-heavy topics too!

I would like to do the Department of Justice because of its interesting topic in hypothetical court cases and domestic events. I chose Christopher A. Wray due to his role as the FBI director and its importance to the United States Federal Government, Jonathan Kanter due to his prominence in the antitrust portion of the DOJ, and Major General Ahmed Naser Al-Raisi due to the nuances of a foreign player in a domestic federal branch setting.

I feel like the sheer global significance of ICAO in transportation defines significant parts on the economy, and this impacts the world. It is also needed to ensure that air safety and air travel is constantly developing and only getting better, whether this is through helping the environment, cheaper prices, or other. I feel like this is also a great topic for MUN that I could be a great delegate for as I see ICAO needing global cooperation as it includes 193 states throughout the world meaning that geopolitics play a major role into this, a topic I am very interested in as it is a part of global interactions and relations. I think what the ICAO does requires very specific planning as the impacts are massive and every consequence needs to be considered, and because the impacts of this are based off what would happen in the real world, I feel like this is a research heavy topic that includes a variety of viewpoints from many delegates and I feel as a delegate of either Chile, Jamaica, or Ghana, I could do a great job representing my own viewpoint while bettering the diplomatic relations with others and coming to a conclusion that benefits all and helps the better of the overall world. With my knowledge of other topics that relate to this like Climate Change, Economic impacts and geopolitical relationships, I think I would be a great fit for the ICAO committee.

Second Committee Choice - International Olympic Committee (IOC): I think I would be a great pick for IOC, but this is not the choice I am as interested in as my first committee choice. I feel like being a delegate for the International Olympic Committee, I could make great arguments about my countries concerns with sports diplomacy as well as my concerns about the ethical, social, and cultural impacts of the debates that take place in IOC. I feel like the IOC has global significance through things like hosting the Olympic Games which is viewed by BILLIONS of viewers worldwide and with me as a delegate, I can make sure that everyones culture gets represented as well as sports diplomacies being settled.

Third Committee Choice - Food and Agriculture Association: I feel like a big problem in this world is the mistreatment of animals, but at the same time, understanding different viewpoints and being a representative for them will allow me to have an open mind and research on a topic that I haven't heavily focused on before, this will allow me to expand my knowledge about the industry significantly, but this committee is not nearly as preferred as my first 1 or 2.","I am a current debater and have made significant progress in just this year with my debate and overall argumentative skills and have greatly changed my viewpoints but at the same time I have been able to been able to represent a variety of viewpoints, even those that I do not fully agree with.",true,true,false,false,Krishna Sridhar,Anuradha Vaidyanathan,true,Standard Delegate,kingmun,34540687CP850122U,45,65dbe1f8d832c0001de3fd26,2024-03-10T05:40:28.838Z,2024-03-13T04:04:43.125Z,Krishna Sridhar,[object Object],IOC,South Africa,

It would also be my first debate where I am speaking as a person and not as a delegate of a nation which should be fun.

Christopher A. Wray - As the current director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he holds power and relevance in both topics of the debate and will be a crucial element of any discussions that go on. This will keep me engaged in debate and will allow me to have maximum fun from the debate experience.

Major General Ahmend Naser Al-Raisi - As the current president of INTERPOL, he hold a large portion of power but is only slightly relevant in one of the topics which is United States V. Attempted Assassination. This means that for the first debate, it will be hard to formulate a relevant opinion which will take fun away from my debate experience.

Steven Dettelbach - Serving as the current director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Dettelbach, similar to Wray, is an American that holds power. However unlike Wray, Dettelbach is not really relevant to either topic meaning formulating opinions in both debates will be a challenge and remove enjoyment from my debate experience.

ABA - ABA is my second option behind DOJ because although the topics are currently extremely relevant, I prefer historical debate which DOJ offers and the positions in DOJ are slightly more appealing

Rajendra SIngh - Its an Indian name and I'm Indian so it could be cool.

Still, alas, I wasn't chosen to participate on the committee. Therefore, I hope that this time, I have the opportunity to join ADHOC.

Next, I find it interesting to debate in the future, as all the conferences I have participated in have been in the ""present.""

The service that it had provided following the end of World War II was vital in ensuring a safe future for many nations. In an era of incredible tumult following the war, the Trusteeship Council played an integral role in facilitating the transition of former colonies into their own independent nations, all while maintaining peace in a difficult time and taking great steps to combat imperialism and colonialism across the world. The Trusteeship Council has shaped the contemporary debate regarding colonialism and its ramifications on former colonies. Having a modern understanding of the Trusteeship Council and its impact while engaging in debate grounded in the historical context of the Trusteeship Council sounds like an incredibly engaging and valuable experience that I would be thrilled to gain. 

Federal laws are an important and necessary staple of the American government, designed to assure the safety of the nation. Reasonable and fair enforcement of these laws is vital to ensure a government that people can trust. This is precisely why the Department of Justice is so important. Participating in a committee with the incredible responsibility of presiding over cases in a way that is impartial yet decisive would be a great opportunity to both gain a better understanding of this importance, as well as improve my skills in debate.

While the primary focus of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is to ensure the wellbeing of workers, it goes beyond that. OSHA’s services may go overlooked as people believe they only aid laborers, but OSHA is truly beneficial to everyone. The mandates that they have in place create a safer environment for workers, and in doing so, create a safer environment for all. Construction and factory workers are invaluable members of our society that deserve to be protected with OSHA’s rules and regulations. Workers rights, fair labor laws, and government interactions with unions are all issues that I am immensely passionate about, and I would be enthused to apply this passion to debate.",,true,true,true,true,SAJ,TBJ,true,Standard Delegate,kingmun,7T551126W55541302,55,,2024-03-13T01:02:51.542Z,2024-03-13T04:04:43.095Z,Sylvia Jarman,[object Object],OSHA,"Ezekiel Richardstock ",

Ueki Emori was a historical figure involved in the political and military actions of the time, though the name might not directly correspond to a widely known individual in the Satsuma Rebellion. This ambiguity provides a fantastic opportunity for creativity and substantial character development within the MUN simulation.

For the Department of Justice committee, given the committee's focus areas mentioned—crime fighting, handling drug cartels, antitrust lawsuits, etc.—it's essential to choose roles that are central to these activities and have clear, impactful mandates. onathan Kanter - The Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division would be directly involved in investigating and prosecuting antitrust cases, a central aspect of DOJ activities. This role provides ample opportunity to influence major economic and legal discussions, presenting a strong case for leadership and initiative, crucial for award recognition.

Selecting impactful positions within the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) committee for a Model United Nations (MUN) conference, especially for KINGMUN 2024, means looking for roles that would be central to OSHA’s mission of ensuring workplace safety and health. Kleen X. Wep - This name suggests a focus on cleanliness and possibly sanitization efforts within workplaces, which are crucial for maintaining safe and healthy working conditions.

Criminal justice has always been a passion of mine, and I have even taken a CJ 101 course through Running Start at Bellevue College. I have a relative understanding of the Justice system in the United States, and I believe I would thrive in the DOJ committee. Furthermore, I do best in non-conventional committees, where I have more room to free-flow and adjust to the conditions much better. I have only been in one non-conventional crisis, at NAIMUN LXI this past winter, but it was one of my most successful ventures at a conference. My first choice for positions is Cynthia M. Ferguson, who I believe is a perfect fit, as I also have a passion for Climate justice and have considered Environmental Law as a potential career path. Though, I am positive I will put in the work and effort needed to properly represent any position within the DOJ. For my second choice committee, I chose OP-HCC. While this is an advanced committee, I believe that as a second option, I would still be able to do very well. I have been in advanced committees before, and I appreciate the challenge that it brings. As for my last choice committee, the F-GA, I went with this committee as I believe that it will offer me an opportunity to push myself to do better, speak more, and try new things. I am also a lover of all things fantasy, so this committee right off the bat seemed like a very interesting chance to explore new concepts.","Myself and my delegation attended NAIMUN LXI, and while I had been somewhat of a ""casual"" MUNer, I believe I have significantly improved in my arguments, speeches, delivery and position paper writing even since then.",true,true,false,false,Kendall Sullivan,Carole Sullivan,true,Standard Delegate,kingmun,,45,65d52895d832c0001de1b88b,2024-03-14T18:11:58.831Z,2024-03-15T03:11:16.675Z,Kendall Sullivan,,,,

I chose Brazil as my first choice because Brazil is an extremely resource-abundant country but has been ravaged by colonizers before who hoped to expose those resources. Debating on the use of these resources will be very interesting as Brazil.

I found that every committee I had visited seemed to be overflowing with happiness, banter, and a memorable time. I would love to be able to partake in a crisis committee, which my MUN friends had encouraged me to do! However, beyond a crisis committee, I think I would enjoy ABA due to my experience in law! I had competed in a form of debate that oversaw policy making, where I've made nationals as well as state. Similarly, I've also made nationals for a form of speech, called US-Extemp, where I prepared speeches and researched unique policies to implement in the US. Furthermore, my partner and I competed, and made nationals and state, in Business Law and Ethics for DECA. I believe my experience in legality, and interest in pursuing law as a future career, may allow me to be a great choice for ABA!","Although I haven't had significant MUN experience as a delegate, beyond participating as an delegate in an advanced committee at KINGMUN last year, I believe I would be able to quickly adapt. I've had experience as a debater, qualifying to state for three years and nationals for two. My partner and I had uniquely competed in public forum, a form of debate that allows us to oversee public policies. The stringent research policies necessary for debate will influence my ability to be an informed delegate! Similarly, I've made state, twice, and nationals in DECA for Business Law and Ethics, an event that similarly oversees policy-making.
